# MessageTranslation
This program helps us understand how encryption and decryption can be used to translate messages the user enters.

The purpose of this program is to understand how encryption and decryption work to understand the 
difference between the value entered by the user and how what it "translates" to. We needed to understand the use of class variables and constants.

Area for improvement: 
Initially, I struggled to understand how we can understand encryption and decryption for our program. 
It was confusing to understand how it was used. 

What I liked: 
I enjoyed learning more about java concepts for this program. The program seemed to relate to security which is enthralling to me!
